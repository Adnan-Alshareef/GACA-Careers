# Oracle Fusion HCM Implementation Project

## Project Overview

This project initially began as a custom careers site development. However, due to a change in the business owner's requirements, it has evolved into an implementation of Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM solution.

## Current Status

We are currently working on implementing and customizing the Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM platform for our organization's recruitment needs.
